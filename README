This is my implementation of Langton's Ant. Langton's Ant is a type of Turing Machine. In the same vein of something like Conway's game of life,
there are a few simple rules which the ants abide by, that in turn result in complex patterns. 

For more information: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Langton%27s_ant

To run this program, enter the following on the command line:

java -jar LangtonAnt.jar [filename] [c] [tile map] [direction map]

Example: java -jar test.txt c tile.txt dir.txt

If filename is left blank, test.txt will be used by default.
If the c option is specified, then custom mappings will be used (explained further down). If c is specified, and either the tile map and direction map
are unspecified tile.txt and dir.txt will be used by default.

The file for the field should be in the following format:

rows cols [empty]
[field(array of numbers)]
Ant row col
Ant row col
	.
	.
	.
Ant row col

If the empty option is set, then a field array is not necessary. The starting field will just be a grid of white squares in that case. If no ants are specified, one will be created by default at row 0, col 0.
The c option refers to custom mappings. Normally the mapping is as follows:

White -> Black, Ant rotates 90 degrees right
Black -> White, Ant rotates 90 degrees left

//****************************************************************************************

You can create your own mappings from a selection of colors as follows. You'll notice that there are two files named tile.txt and dir.txt.

tile.txt refers to the mappings the colors follow, what each color turns into. It should be in the following format:

Color Color
Color Color
	.
	.
	.
Color Color

Note that you do not have to use all 13 colors available, but a color may not map to more than one color.

The second component to a custom mapping is a direction mapping. For this you use dir.txt via the following format: 

Color direction
Color direction
	.
	.
	.
Color direction

Where direction may be left or right. Every color you used in tile.txt must be mapped to a direction, or you will get an error.

The following colors may be used (not case-sensitive, underscore must be included if applicable):

WHITE = 0
BLACK = 1
BLUE = 2
CYAN = 3
DARK_GRAY = 4
GRAY = 5
GREEN = 6
LIGHT_GRAY = 7
MAGENTA = 8
ORANGE = 9
PINK = :
RED = ;
YELLOW = <

The characters correspond to the colors that are used for the field. 

For more info on custom mappings check the Extensions to Multiple Colors section on the wikipedia page.

Currently the default dir.txt and tile.txt use a cyclic pattern called LLRR which causes the mass to proliferate symmetrically.
